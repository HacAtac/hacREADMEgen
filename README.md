 <p>Dealing mainly with node.js, inquire, template literals this project has been a blast and has taught me a lot!</p>

 <ul>
   <li>First i've set up the file structure for the Markdown, writereadme, app.js</li>
   <li>Then I've used inquire to make a short questionare regarding potential repository information</li>
   <li>Using the command line to run this program with node.js</li>
   <li>Then I've utilized fs require to utilize certain packages and files to connect eachother</li>
   <li>I then have used template literals with ${to target certain parameters to pass through} for a quality README.md generator</li>
